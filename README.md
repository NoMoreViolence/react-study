# REACT.JS Skeleton

This is not a copy file, this is a file for my study. there is no Illegal element

This project is a React workspace that you can simply start working on React.js project right away.

React 0.14.7, Babel 6 and webpack on Node.js is used to setup the environment.

## How to use

* `npm install` - Install the dependency
* `npm start` -Run the development server

_The default server port number is set to_ **7777**

## How to use different port number

If there's another process which already took the port 7777 or you want to use different port number, you can specify different port number.

* `npm start -- --port=[your favorite port]`
  * For example, you can type `npm start -- --port=9999` if you want to start the server in port 9999.
